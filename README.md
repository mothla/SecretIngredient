# What is the idea of the program?
**A program that help the user scan or search a product and let the program compare the prices of the product by various supermarkets.**
# Connected python with database
**We used two methods to store data, the first method is a textfile, and the second method is connecting program to Oracle database.**

# The Oracle database
**We have 3 tables, one for the products information (ID, product name, product barcode). A second table with all the vendors name and IDs. Last one to connect the two tables together along with a new attribute which is the price attribute.**

**We scan and search about a product name '7 days croissant' -product image and barcodes pictures below-**
